    <description><![CDATA[In one of my earlier posts, I had mentioned the preprocessing step for counting the number of people from multiple partially overlapping views. This step involves stitching of the images together to form a single image which is then passed into the counting module (code). This might result in a performance overhead compared to the normal case, this can be balanced by adjusting the skip_frames parameter in the code. The stitching algorithm used here is based on the publication.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I so pumped up right now because I passed the first evaluation and will be getting paid soon ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜…. This has been a wonderful journey till now and I have no idea how the time passed so fast. Someone once said, &ldquo;Do what you love, you never have to work a day in your life&rdquo;, I guess I have seen the truth to this statement. I am extremely grateful to my mentors for giving me the freedom to explore many things in this endeavor and without even knowing it I have learned so much ðŸ˜ƒ.]]></description>

    <title>Contribution 7: Filtering Methods</title>

    <description><![CDATA[This will be my last post for the first phase of my GSoC journey. I had promised to deliver a working module that returns the count of people from a single view through a continuous video feed. From my earlier post, you might have seen the challenges I had faced and the solutions I had proposed. I had mentioned that use of filtering techniques may help smooth out unrealistic jumps in a continuous video feed, I had resorted to two major methods which proved to improve the performance of the count values return with the SS-DCNet model namely,]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In my earlier post, I had mentioned that the people counter based on the SSDCNet model fails sometimes when the place is very scarcely populated. So I compared its performance with a counter based on the SSDNet model. Given below is an example of footage of 18 people (SALSA dataset).   With SS-DCNet based counter     With SSDNet based counter   We can see that the SSDCNet based counter performs better in comparison with the SSD based approach.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have successfully completed the first milestone of my GSoC which was to count people present in the scene given a video feed using existing deep Net models. In my earlier post, I had mentioned that I will be going foreward with the SS-DCNet model due the advantages which I had discussed. I have used the models that were trained the Shanghai Dataset(A, B) and QRNF dataset by the authors of the SS-DCNet paper(ICCV 2019).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In my earlier post, I had mentioned two approaches to count people. So, I have gone through the proposed methods namely:
 CSRNet SS-DCNet Deep-SORT  As I have already mentioned, CSRNet and SS-DCNet are suited to cases when we have footage that is from within the room by keeping a running count of the number of people in the room frame-by-frame. Both these networks work well for densely crowded places.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The project phase has started. I have made a standalone python project to count people which will be my baseline to test different methods. You can find it here. This is a refactored version of the existing PeopleCounter module of RoboComp. Once, the most suited method is chosen, I will integrate it with RoboComp architecture which forms the final stage of the project.
  A short demo   So there, two ways to count people inside a building:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So the project phase is going to start in few days and I am so under the pump ðŸ˜ƒ. I had promised my mentors that I will look through existing methods that can be used to count and track people and find out which approach works better by testing all of them. The methods I want to look at are:
 CSRnet SS-DCNet Deep SORT
I am in the process of setting up necessary environments for each of the methods.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[After considering declining support for Python 2 programming language and added benefits from upgrades to Python 3, it is always advisable for a developer to select Python version 3. So, from the statement above, it is pretty much obvious that the first task assigned to me was porting the People Counter module from Python 2 to Python 3 which is done. Changes made are:
 Changed all print statements from print &quot; &quot; to print().]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I had submitted a pull-request to update the file specificworker.py in the component openpifpafserver. These added lines are some parameters which are in the file and not specifying these values lead to Attribute errors. I initialized all these parameters to the default values specified in the openpifpaf package. I belive this should solve the issue. This pull-request is still under review and I will update the post when the status changes.]]></description>
