    <description><![CDATA[This will be my last post for the first phase of my GSoC journey. I had promised to deliver a working module that returns the count of people from a single view through a continuous video feed. From my earlier post, you might have seen the challenges I had faced and the solutions I had proposed. I had mentioned that use of filtering techniques may help smooth out unrealistic jumps in a continuous video feed, I had resorted to two major methods which proved to improve the performance of the count values return with the SS-DCNet model namely,]]></description>

    <title>SSDCNet vs SSDNet</title>

    <description><![CDATA[In my earlier post, I had mentioned that the people counter based on the SSDCNet model fails sometimes when the place is very scarcely populated. So I compared its performance with a counter based on the SSDNet model. Given below is an example of footage of 18 people (SALSA dataset).   With SS-DCNet based counter     With SSDNet based counter   We can see that the SSDCNet based counter performs better in comparison with the SSD based approach.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I have successfully completed the first milestone of my GSoC which was to count people present in the scene given a video feed using existing deep Net models. In my earlier post, I had mentioned that I will be going foreward with the SS-DCNet model due the advantages which I had discussed. I have used the models that were trained the Shanghai Dataset(A, B) and QRNF dataset by the authors of the SS-DCNet paper(ICCV 2019).]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[In my earlier post, I had mentioned two approaches to count people. So, I have gone through the proposed methods namely:
 CSRNet SS-DCNet Deep-SORT  As I have already mentioned, CSRNet and SS-DCNet are suited to cases when we have footage that is from within the room by keeping a running count of the number of people in the room frame-by-frame. Both these networks work well for densely crowded places.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The project phase has started. I have made a standalone standalone python project to count people which will be my baseline to test different methods. You can find it here. This is a refactored version of the existing PeopleCounter module of RoboComp. Once, the most suited method is chosen, I will integrate it with RoboComp architecture which forms the final stage of the project.
  A short demo   So there, two ways to count people inside a building:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[So the project phase is going to start in few days and I am so under the pump ðŸ˜ƒ. I had promised my mentors that I will look through existing methods that can be used to count and track people and find out which approach works better by testing all of them. The methods I want to look at are:
 CSRnet SS-DCNet Deep SORT
I am in the process of setting up necessary environments for each of the methods.]]></description>

    <title>Contribution 4: Porting to Python 3 and and other changes</title>

    <description><![CDATA[After considering declining support for Python 2 programming language and added benefits from upgrades to Python 3, it is always advisable for a developer to select Python version 3. So, from the statement above, it is pretty much obvious that the first task assigned to me was porting the People Counter module from Python 2 to Python 3 which is done. Changes made are:
 Changed all print statements from print &quot; &quot; to print().]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I had submitted a pull-request to update the file specificworker.py in the component openpifpafserver. These added lines are some parameters which are in the file and not specifying these values lead to Attribute errors. I initialized all these parameters to the default values specified in the openpifpaf package. I belive this should solve the issue. This pull-request is still under review and I will update the post when the status changes.]]></description>

    <title>Contribution 2: Fixing import errors</title>

    <description><![CDATA[I found this issue because I was still unable to get the PeopleCounter component working. It raised an import error there where some functions imported from the resources directory, which is outside the working directory. My commit ensures that the python modules are imported properly. I had made a pull-request for them the same which is still under review. I will update this post once the status changes.
Status: Under Review ]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This post is about my very first bug fix in RoboComp&rsquo;s human-detection repository. Everybody starts with a very small bug, so did I. I found this issue on March 16(before the student application deadline) when I was trying to get the PeopleCounter module working on my PC. I realized that there was a line missing in the config file that hosts the People Server. I also found that a path to MobileNetSSD_deploy.]]></description>
